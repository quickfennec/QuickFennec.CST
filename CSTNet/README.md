# CST.NET

Caret-Separated Text (or CST) is a key-value pair format represented by digits or words as keys and the value as text enclosed between carets. (e.g. ``<key> ^<text>^``) Any text which is not enclosed with carets is considered a comment and ignored. Neither strings nor comments may use the caret character. CST.NET is a library for parsing the CST format.
